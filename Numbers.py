# There are three forms of numeric values: integers, decimals (called a float), complex numbers

a = 16
b = -32 # Both of these are integers

c = 3.14
d = -5.6 # Both of these are decimals (called floats)

e = 3j
f = -7 + 8j # These are complexes (using imaginary numbers) - always using 'j'

# Any type can be converted into another type here, but complex numbers cannot be casted into anything
# int <-> float
# float/int -> complex
