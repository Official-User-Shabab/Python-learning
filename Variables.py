x = 8 # simple assignment using "="
name = "Python" # can be any data types [string, integer, float etc.]
x = 13 # variables are easily changed too, but wil stay same if no new assignment is done further along the code

age = str(3) # these functions such as str(), int(), and float() are used to convert from one data type to another

# Capital letters are different from lowercase letters
me = "not you"
Me2 = "not YOU" # clearly these are different variables
mE = 'still not you' # strings can be just one speech mark too! (not preferred)

# DO NOT START A VARIABLE NAME WITH A NUMBER OR SYMBOL
# DO NOT USE A PYTHON KEYWORD LIKE "print"
# ONLY USE ALPHANUMERIC CHARACHTERS AND UNDERSCORES IN YOUR VARIABLE NAME

# Think of variables like boxes that hold a value, a string, number, decimal, whatever
