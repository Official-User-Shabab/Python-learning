# str means string
# int means integer
# float means float
# bool is boolean, expressed as True, or False
# these will be the most common ones you would be using

name = str(input("What's your name?_")) # note that input (taken in) is by default always a string
age = int(input("How old are you?_")) # so here the integer function was used to convert the string to integer (casting)

x = 6
print(type(x)) # this function outputs the data type of a variable
